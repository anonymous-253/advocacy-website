<font color=#ff8fa0>
<h1><li>Advocacy means to benefit people who require some help navigating the world of health and social care. Through advocacy, you or your loved one can be supported to express your views and wishes. You’ll also be given the confidence to stand up for your rights (or somebody can do this on your behalf). Somebody who does these things for you is known as an advocate. Advocacy also mean to empower people to have a voice, to speak for them when they can't, and supporting them to speak for themselves when they can.
