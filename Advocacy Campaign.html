<h1>୨⊹ WHAT IS AN ADVOCACY CAMPAIGN? ⊹୧</h1>
<br>
<font color=#ff8fa0>
<h1>An advocacy campaign is an organized set of actions designed to raise awareness on issues and influence change. They’re often led by a group of leaders—such as students—who mobilize volunteers to support a particular issue or call for new policies.</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>⋆Advocacies don’t have to be grand to become relevant. Many campaigns aim to address a small subset of a much larger issue. For example, rather than dreaming of a huge goal to lobby against worldwide drought, focusing on a core location can make your advocacy more achievable. This approach is also a lot easier to commit to for students.</h2>
